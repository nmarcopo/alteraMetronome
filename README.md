# Logic Design Midterm Project: Metronome

# Addendum:
This class was the first where I *really* felt I was a college student. By that, I mean that I was finally out of the prerequisites of Notre Dame's college of engineering and dove right into the computer sciencey stuff. Dr. Brockman is one of the best lecturers I've ever met - he takes these difficult logic concepts and breaks them into small bits that we can easily understand.  

To run this program, you need an Altera DE2-115 FPGA board and the Quartus Prime software, which you probably don't have. I've linked some resources that can help you see what this project was all about:
